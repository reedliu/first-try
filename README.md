### Who am I?
- I am a graduate from College of Plant Protection, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Province, China. While I spent three years in Institute of Plant Protection,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing for joint education.ã€€
- At beginning, my job was raising the cotton bollworm species to dectect its resistance status, but that's not my dish. So, in the last year, I found love for bioinformatics. And I decided to start on my own to be the first bioinformatician in the lab. All efforts are worth, I learned RNA-seq, Whole-genome seq analysis and want to move on Chip-seq.
- In my future, I want to move on medical research especially human cancer. The reason is simple that I want to give my little effort to this honorable work
